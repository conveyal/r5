# R<sup>5</sup>: Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks

R<sup>5</sup> is a fast routing engine for multimodal (transit/bike/walk/car) networks. It is currently designed
for analytic applications but there are plans to eventually have it support point-to-point journey planning.
The routing is "realistic" because it works by planning many trips over a time window, which is more reflective of how people
use the transportation system than planning a single trip at an exact departure time---very few people leave for work at precisely
7:53 AM every morning, and even fewer leave at a precise time when going to a non-work event. There's more information on our thinking
on this particular point [here](http://conveyal.com/blog/2015/05/04/variation-in-accessibility-measures/).

## History

R<sup>5</sup> grew out of several open-source projects. The focus on analytic applications, and the core development team behind R<sup>5</sup>,
came from [OpenTripPlanner](http://opentripplanner.org). Many of the algorithms, as well as the name, came from [r4](https://github.com/bliksemlabs/rrrr).
