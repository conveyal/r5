/**
 * These are the top-level modules of our analysis backend that are instantiated and wired up to one
 * another when the application starts up. There is typically only one instance of each component,
 * and all references to the component are final.
 *
 * <p>Each component should encapsulate a distinct, well-defined set of functionality. Different
 * implementations of components allow running locally or in other environments like AWS or
 * potentially other cloud service providers. Currently this is a marker interface with no methods,
 * just to indicate the role of certain classes in the project.
