/**
 * We are adopting a lightweight dependency injection approach, where we manually wire up our
 * components instead of relying on a framework. For our simple case the approach is almost
 * identical but we have to manage the order in which the components are instantiated. This amounts
 * to a manual depth-first traversal of the dependency graph which is not prohibitive for a limited
 * number of components.
 *
 * <p>This class is like an "application context" in dependency injection frameworks, so could also
 * be renamed "Context". It keeps references to all components of the system in one place. These
 * components are typically singleton instances of classes. Making the components instances (rather
 * than classes grouping together static fields and methods) allows them to be replaced with other
 * implementations, e.g. to switch between different authentication or storage systems.
 *
 * <p>Ideally we'd want these to be final fields, but that prevents us from setting them from
 * non-constructor methods including subclass constructors. Eventually they could be protected, but
 * that's also not possible yet because for the time being we still set up some static functionality
 * and the HttpApi by peeking into the components instance.
 *
 * <p>Really, outside code should never reference these component fields, and this class should be
 * essentially unused after application construction. Each component should hold final references to
 * all the other components it needs, and those references should be passed into the component's
 * constructor by the wiring-up code.
 *
 * <p>Some environment-specific bindings depend on some standard bindings and vice versa. Therefore
 * it's not practical to split into two methods, one instantiating shared standard bindings and one
 * instantiating custom bindings. We could instead define methods to provide a binding for each
 * interface, but that seems like overkill generalization. We only expect to ever have 2-3 variants
 * of this class. Just make a new subclass and complete constructor for each.
