/**
 * This provides application-wide queues of one-off or repeating tasks. It ensures that some tasks
 * repeat regularly while others are completed without too many tasks being handled concurrently.
 * The two separate executors provide a "heavy" executor (for slow tasks) and a "light" executor
 * (for fast tasks, the "passing lane"), each with a number of threads that can be limited in the
 * main analysis.properties configuration file to help limit heavy concurrent operations.
 *
 * <p>The heavy/light distinction is somewhat like a work-stealing pool (see Javadoc on
 * Executors.newWorkStealingPool()). However with the workStealingPool we have no guarantees it will
 * create more than one queue, or on execution order. The implementation with ExecutorServices also
 * seems to allow more control over tasks causing exceptions.
 *
 * <p>===
 *
 * <p>This also serves to report active tasks for a given user. That could be considered a separate
 * function, but it ended up having a bidirectional dependency on this TaskScheduler so they've been
 * merged.
 *
 * <p>===
 *
 * <p>This is moving in the direction of having a single unified task management and reporting
 * system across the backend and workers. It could be interesting to gather task status from the
 * whole cluster of workers and merge them together into one view. This could conceivably even
 * include regional analyses and chunks of work for regional analyses on workers. But even if such
 * merging doesn't occur, it will be convenient to always report progress from backend and workers
 * to the UI in the same data structures.
 *
 * <p>So we're moving toward a programming API where you submit Tasks with attached Actions. TODO
 * state that all Components should be threadsafe, i.e. should not fail if used by multiple HTTP
 * handler threads.
 *
 * <p>Eventually every asynchronous task should be handled by this one mechanism, to ensure every
 * Throwable is caught and cannot kill threads, as well as standardized reporting and tracking of
 * backend and worker activity.
