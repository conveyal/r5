/**
 * This class distributes the tasks making up regional jobs to workers.
 * <p>
 * It should aim to draw tasks fairly from all organizations, and fairly from all jobs within each
 * organization, while attempting to respect the transport network affinity of each worker, giving
 * the worker tasks that require the same network it has been using recently.
 * <p>
 * Previously workers long-polled for work, holding lots of connections open. Now they short-poll
 * and sleep for a while if there's no work. This is simpler and allows us to work withing much more
 * standard HTTP frameworks.
 * <p>
 * The fact that workers continuously re-poll for work every 10-30 seconds serves as a signal to the
 * broker that they are still alive and waiting. This also allows the broker to maintain a catalog
 * of active workers.
 * <p>
 * Because (at least currently) two organizations never share the same graph, we can get by with
 * pulling tasks cyclically or randomly from all the jobs, and actively shape the number of workers
 * with affinity for each graph by forcing some of them to accept tasks on graphs other than the one
 * they have declared affinity for.
 * <p>
 * This could be thought of as "affinity homeostasis". We  will constantly keep track of the ideal
 * proportion of workers by graph (based on active jobs), and the true proportion of consumers by
 * graph (based on incoming polling), then we can decide when a worker's graph affinity should be
 * ignored and what it should be forced to.
 * <p>
 * It may also be helpful to mark jobs every time they are skipped in the LRU queue. Each time a job
 * is serviced, it is taken out of the queue and put at its end. Jobs that have not been serviced
 * float to the top.
 * <p>
 * Most methods on this class are synchronized, because they can be called from many HTTP handler
 * threads at once.
 *
 * TODO evaluate whether synchronizing all methods to make this threadsafe is a performance issue.
