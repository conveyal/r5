/**
 * Sometimes a custom component needs to receive notifications from standard components. The
 * standard component does not know about the custom component, so cannot call it directly. The
 * standard component can export a listener interface and mechanisms to register and call listeners,
 * but then this logic has to be repeated on any class that has sends events to listeners. An event
 * bus is essentially shared listener registration across all components.
 *
 * <p>By default execution of the handlers receiving events is asynchronous (handled by a shared
 * pool of threads). An alternate send method exists for synchronous handling, in the thread that
 * sent the event. One must be careful not to trigger self-amplifying event loops which amount to
 * infinite recursion in the synchronous case, and an ever-expanding event queue in the async case.
 * Therefore event handlers should never themselves trigger more events.
