/**
 * Provides a lightweight heartbeat endpoint by which the UI signals that a user is active, and the backend reports
 * any progress and status updates for that user. To determine which users are active we can't depend purely on backend
 * API requests, because many UI requests read and write straight to Mongo via Next lambda functions.
 *
 * The UI is expected to poll this endpoint at least once every 30 seconds whenever its tab is focused and the user
 * appears to be active, and whenever the user becomes active after a period of inactivity. Any user who has not hit
 * this endpoint for over 30 seconds is considered idle.
 *
 * The backend response will contain a list of all asynchronous tasks it is currently handling for the user.
 * Once a task is finished, the next time it is fetched it will be cleared from the backend. When the user is clearly
 * waiting for a task to finish, the UI may poll this endpoint more frequently to get smoother progress updates.
