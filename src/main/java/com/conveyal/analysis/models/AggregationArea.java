/**
 * An aggregation area defines a set of origin points that can be combined to produce an aggregate accessibility figure.
 * For example, if we have accessibility results for an entire city, we might want to calculate 25th percentile
 * population-weighted accessibility for each administrative district. Each neighborhood would be an aggreagation area.
 *
 * An aggregation area is defined by a polygon that has been rasterized and stored as a grid, with each pixel value
 * expressing how much of that pixel falls within the mask polygon. These values are in the range of 0 to 100,000
 * (rather than 0 to 1) because our serialized (on-disk) grid format can only store integers.
