/**
 * Write regional analysis results arriving from workers into a binary grid format. This how we
 * store accessibility indicators for sets of origin points lying on regular grids.
 * <p>
 * During distributed computation of access to gridded destinations, workers return raw results for
 * single origins to the worker while polling. These results contain one accessibility measurement
 * per origin grid cell. This class assembles these results into a single large file containing a
 * delta-coded version of the same data for all origin points.
 * <p>
 * Access grids look like this:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Header (ASCII text "ACCESSGR", note that this header is eight bytes, so the full grid can be
 *         mapped into a Javascript typed array of 4-byte integers if desired)</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) File format version</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) Web mercator zoom level</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) west (x) edge of the grid, i.e. how many pixels this grid is east of the left edge of the world</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) north (y) edge of the grid, i.e. how many pixels this grid is south of the top edge of the world</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) width of the grid in pixels</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) height of the grid in pixels</li>
 * <li>(4 byte int) number of values (channels) per pixel</li>
 * <li>(repeated 4-byte int) values of each pixel in row-major order: axis order (row, column, channel).</li>
 * </ol>
