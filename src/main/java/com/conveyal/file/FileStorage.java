 * For simplicity, methods that store and remove files are all blocking calls. If you add a file, all other components
 * of the system are known to be able to see it as soon as the method returns. This does not handle storing file
 * metadata in MongoDB. That is a separate concern. Workers need to get files without looking into our database.
 * Our file metadata handling component could wrap FileStorage, so all backend file operations implicitly had metadata.
