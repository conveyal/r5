 * (typically the bundle-scoped feed ID of the GTFS feed the geometries are drawn from). This is based on a Caffeine
 * LoadingCache so should be thread safe and provide granular per-key locking, which is convenient when serving up
 * lots of simultaneous vector tile requests.
 *
 * This is currently used only for looking up geometries when producing Mapbox vector map tiles, hence the single
 * set of hard-wired cache eviction parameters. For more general use we'd want another constructor to change them.
