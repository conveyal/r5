/**
 * Field subclasses process an incoming String that represents a single GTFS CSV field value. The
 * value is validated and converted to its final format. We need to propagate any validation errors
 * up to the caller (where file, line, and column number context are known), Unfortunately Java does
 * not allow multiple return values. There are multiple options. We could emulate multiple return by
 * wrapping the resulting String in another object that combines it with an error type. We could
 * pass a list into every function and the functions could add errors to that list. We could make
 * the Field instances have state, which will also make them single-use and single-thread. They
 * could then accumulate errors as they do their work. We could return an error or list of errors
 * from functions that store the validated value into an array passed in as a parameter. In all
 * cases, to avoid enormous amounts of useless object creation we could re-use error lists and just
 * clear them before each validation operation. However, within the Field implementations, we may
 * need to call private/internal functions that also return multiple values (an error and a modified
 * value).
