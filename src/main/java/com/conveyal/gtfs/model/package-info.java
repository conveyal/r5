/**
 * This package contains an alternative to the GTFS loading classes we have been using from OBA. It
 * loads GTFS into a disk-backed map and attempts to be relatively efficient space-wise. The intent
 * is to eliminate the need for AgencyAndIds, using feed IDs and keeping each feed in its own
 * separate data structure.
