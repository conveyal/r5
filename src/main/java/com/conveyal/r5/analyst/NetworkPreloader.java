/**
 * This either returns a network that can be immediately used for a certain analysis task (if it's already prepared)
 * or kicks off an asynchronous task to prepare such a network, and reports status to the caller. See #381.
 *
 * The steps that need to happen to prepare a network for analysis are the following:
 * 1. Download and load the network if it's already built.
 * 2. Build the network if it's not already built.
 * 3. Apply the scenario to the network, or fetch the resulting network if the scenario is already applied.
 * 3. Pre-compute stop-to-vertex distance tables and linkages (stop-to-point distance tables) for the walking mode.
 * 4. Create or a destination pointset based on this specific task and the pointSetCache.
 * 5. Link that pointset to the street network with the right mode, basing distances on the stop-to-vertex tables
 * created above.
 *
 * The network building is done as part of requesting the network.
 * The distance tables are constructed as part of the scenario application. So the main steps to trigger explicitly are:
 * 1. Fetch the network
 * 2. Apply the scenario
 * 3. Build the linkages
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * We don't want to just make all the caches (network, grid, linkage, etc.) asynchronous because we don't want the first
 * HTTP request to only asynchronously load the network, then the second one to apply the scenario and trigger the
 * distance table computation, then the third one to link the destination grids for a particular mode. We want all the
 * steps to be done at one go. Therefore we want a single asynchronous action at the top level, which cascades a lot of
 * sequential synchronous actions interspersed with progress updates.
 *
 * The incoming request may not have a scenario ID in it, in which case it should contain the entire scenario.
 * TransportNetwork.getNetworkForScenario() resolves it as follows:
 * String scenarioId = request.scenarioId != null ? request.scenarioId : request.scenario.id;
 *
 * I was initially trying to implement this with a Caffeine AsyncLoadingCache, but ran into the following problems:
 * 1. The cache values must be computed from the key only. But expanded scenarios may be contained in the request.
 * 2. We want to provide progress information, and retrofitting the Caffeine cache with it would be just as complicated
 *    as making our own new class.
 * 3. We don't really want to trigger callbacks after the asynchronous loading is finished, we just want to know
 *    immediately at the time of each HTTP request whether it's finished building or not.
 *
 * Repeatedly re-sending a full Analysis task over HTTP just to see if the network is ready (and failing if it's not)
 * seems like an inefficient way to report progress. But it is a good incremental step within the current architecture.
 * We may want to enqueue tasks like we do in Data Tools, with continuous progress reporting. That's the only thing
 * that will truly meet user expectations, but will require a task tracking mechanism and API, so that's another issue.
 *
 * One tricky thing is that the network may be mostly available and need only one small action, e.g. applying a very
 * simple scenario. Ideally we'd block for a short time (e.g. one second) waiting on the prepared network, then only
 * report progress if that operation times out.
 *
 * Currently we're returning only the network, and the rest of the needed data are nested inside that network in
 * caches (which can suffer eviction). Perhaps this class should instead prepare and return a wrapper type that bundles
 * together all the needed data (network, distance tables, linkages) loaded by the preloader.
