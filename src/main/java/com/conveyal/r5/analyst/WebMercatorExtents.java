     * This static utility method returns a Coordinate in units of meters (as defined in the CRS EPSG:3857) for the
     * given absolute (world) x and y pixel numbers at the given zoom level.
     *
     * Typically we express spherical mercator coordinates as pixels at some non-negative integer zoom level. At zoom
     * level zero, these correspond to the pixels in a single tile 256 pixels square, i.e. 2^8 pixels on a side. At each
     * successive zoom level, the tile is split in half in each dimension, defining four sub-tiles. Thus coordinates
     * at a different zoom level can be obtained by right or left bit-shifting by the difference in zoom levels, and
     * the tile number is simply the most significant bits of the coordinate with the 8 intra-tile bits shifted off.
     *
     * The projection cuts off at just over 85 degrees latitude, such that the single zoom level zero tile is square.
     * Pixel numbers follow computer graphics conventions, with y increasing toward the south (down) and x to the east.
     * At zoom zero, integer x and y coordinates each fit in one unsigned byte, and resolution can be doubled 23 times
     * without overflowing a standard 32 bit signed integer (i.e. 31 non-sign bits minus the 8 used at zoom level zero).
     * Although this allows for 23 zoom levels, in practice we rarely see more than 18.
     *
     * However, for some reason EPSG specifies units of meters rather than pixels, so our pixel-oriented coordinates
     * must be scaled to match the circumference of the earth. Furthermore EPSG places the origin at latitude and
     * longitude (0,0) using positive and negative coordinates, rather than using nonnegative coordinates and an origin
     * in the northwest corner, so we have to translate all coordinates halfway around the world.
     *
     * The meter was originally defined as 1/10k of the distance from the equator to the pole (with a bit of error), so
     * the earth's circumference is roughly four times this value, at about 40k kilometers. The distance from the origin
     * halfway around the world to +180 should be roughly 20k kilometers.
     *
     * We can determine the value spherical Mercator uses for the width of the world by transforming WGS84 coordinates:
     * $ gdaltransform -s_srs epsg:4326 -t_srs epsg:3857
     * 180, 0
     * 20037508.3427892 -7.08115455161362e-10 0
     *
     * You can't do 180, 90 because there would be a singularity at 90 degrees and this projection is cut off above a
     * certain latitude to make the world square. But you can do the reverse projection to find the cutoff latitude:
     * $ gdaltransform -s_srs epsg:3857 -t_srs epsg:4326
     * 20037508.342789, 20037508.342789
     * 179.999999999998 85.0511287798064 0
     *
     * @param xPixel absolute (world) x pixel number at the specified zoom level, increasing eastward
     * @param yPixel absolute (world) y pixel number at the specified zoom level, increasing southward
     * @return a Coordinate in units of meters, as defined in the CRS EPSG:3857
