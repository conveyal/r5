/**
 * Cache Web Mercator Grid Pointsets so that they are not recreated and relinked on every regional analysis task.
 * The cache does not have expiration, which is fine, because it exists on the workers which are short-lived.
 * This is a loading cache, that will compute values when they are absent: the values are not explicitly added by the
 * caller.
 *
 * The WebMercatorGridPointSets are very small and fetching one doesn't include linking.
 * We cache these objects because once they are linked,they contain the linkages, and creating the linkages takes a
 * lot of time.
 *
 * Note that this cache will be serialized with the PointSet, but serializing a Guava cache only serializes the
 * cache instance and its settings, not the contents of the cache. We consider this sane behavior.
