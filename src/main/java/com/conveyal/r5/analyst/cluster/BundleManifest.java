 * Originally transportation data "bundles" were a zip file of GTFS files and OSM files. OSM data is
 * no longer specific to a GTFS feed, at least within our UI. OSM is now associated with a whole
 * project. So "new-style" bundles are no longer zip files of data, they are just references to OSM
 * and GTFS files on S3. The fields in this class do not contain filenames but IDs that will be
 * sanitized and have file extensions added before being looked up as S3 objects.
