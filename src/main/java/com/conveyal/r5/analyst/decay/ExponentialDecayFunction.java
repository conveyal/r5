/**
 * This an exponential decay function where the cutoff parameter c is treated as the half-life. So
 * rather than working with the base e, we use: N(t) = 2^(-t/c) = 0.5^(t/c) Exp() is usually faster
 * than the more general pow(). Since pow(x,y) = exp(y*log(x)) and we generally hold c constant
 * while varying t: N(t) = exp(log(0.5) * t/c) JIT may be smart enough to factor the
 * (log(0.5)/cutoff) out of the series of method calls, without us needing to create specific
 * function instances with precomputed constants for each separate cutoff.
