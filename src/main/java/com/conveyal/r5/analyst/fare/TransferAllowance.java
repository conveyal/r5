/**
For Pareto searches that include as an optimization criterion monetary cost based on fares, we need to label states
with information about the potential value of future transfer allowances.  A standard GTFS fare_attribute can include
 a numeric limit on number of subsequent transfers, as well as a time_duration, but it doesn't have a good way of
 representing the potential value of a transfer allowance that a passenger may obtain upon paying a fare.  This class
 is meant to represent that value and restrictions on how it can be redeemed in subsequent rides. These restrictions
 are specific to fare systems and may include limitations on the number of subsequent transfers, which routes accept
 the transfer (e.g. only routes from a certain agency), and the duration of the value's validity.
