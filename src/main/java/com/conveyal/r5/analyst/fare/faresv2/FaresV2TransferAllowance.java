     * When useAllStopsWhenCalculatingAsRouteFareNetwork = true in FaresV2InRoutingFareCalculator, we need to
     * differentiate trips inside as_route fare networks by the fare zones they use, not just the board stop.
     *
     * potentialAsRouteFareLegRules should contain all the fare leg rules that could apply to the as_route trip. More
     * specifically, two conditions must hold for potentialAsRouteFareLegs: 1) it must include the fare leg rule that
     * represents the full extent of the trip (e.g. for a B - C - A trip, it must include C - A), and 2) it must _not_ include
     * any fare leg rule larger than the full extent of the trip. (Full extent imagines the fare zones as being linear,
     * but in Toronto where this useAllStopsWhenCalculatingAsRouteFareNetwork we are taking "full extent" to mean "most
     * expensive", and though space is two-dimensional, money is one-dimensional.) If the most expensive fare leg rules
     * are in this array, then the same logic should apply - two routes that have the same most expensive fare leg rule(s)
     * cover the same extents.
     *
     * To keep this tractable, the array only retains the fare leg rules with the lowest order
     * (as set in fare_leg_rules.txt). Thus, the fare leg rulefor the full extent must always have the
     * lowest order in the feed. This is generally true anyways, since the fare leg rule with the lowest
     * order will be the one returned, but if A-B and A-C are the same price, you might be sloppy
     * and assign order randomly for these two fare pairs. But to get proper transfer allowance domination logic, A-C
     * must have a lower order or the same order as A-B. If they have the same fare and transfer privileges, routing will
     * not be affected if they have the same order - the A-B fare leg may be used when A-C should really be, but that
     * will not affect the result as the two fare legs are equivalent, and A-C will still appear in this array and satisfy
     * the two conditions above.
     *
     * If both of these conditions hold, then the two journeys with the same potentialAsRouteFareRules cover the same
     * territory and can be considered equivalent.
     *
     * Proof:
     * Suppose without loss of generality that fare leg rules 1 and 2 are the most expensive ("full extent") for journey
     * Q, and R.potentialAsRouteFareLegRules == Q.potentialAsRouteFareRules.
     *
     * 1. By condition 1, if 1 and 2 are the most extensive/expensive fare leg rules for journey Q, then they must appear in
     * Q.potentialAsRouteFareRules.
     * 2. By condition 2, no other more expensive/extensive fare leg rules can appear in Q.potentialAsRouteFareRules.
     * 3. If Q.potentialAsRouteFareRules == R.potentialAsRouteFareRules, then 1 and 2 are the most expensive/extensive
     *    fare leg rules for R as well as Q.
     * 4. Q and R are thus equally extensive/expensive.
