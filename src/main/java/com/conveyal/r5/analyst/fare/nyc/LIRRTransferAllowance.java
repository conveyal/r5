/**
 * Calculates fares for and represents transfer allowances on the MTA Long Island Rail Road. One
 * nice thing is that the LIRR is a small network, so we can be kinda lazy with how many journey
 * prefixes get eliminated - we only consider journey prefixes comparable under the more strict
 * domination rules (Theorem 3.2 in the paper at
 * https://files.indicatrix.org/Conway-Stewart-2019-Charlie-Fare-Constraints.pdf) if they boarded at
 * the same stop, alighted at the same stop, used the same stop to transfer from inbound to outbound
 * (if there was an opposite-direction transfer), and used the same combination of peak/offpeak
 * services.
 *
 * <p>LIRR fares are really complicated, because of complex and undocumented transfer rules. The
 * fare chart is available at http://web.mta.info/lirr/about/TicketInfo/Fares.htm, but it does not
 * include anything about fares where you have to ride inbound and then outbound (for instance,
 * based on the fare chart, Montauk to Greenport on the eastern end of Long Island are both in Zone
 * 14, and thus should be a $3.25 fare, but to get between them, you have to ride at least to
 * Bethpage (Zone 7). So there must be a more expensive fare, because otherwise anyone who was going
 * from Montauk to Babylon, say, would just say they were planning to transfer and go back outbound.
 *
 * <p>LIRR deals with this situation by specifying via fares. They have no documentation on these
 * that I can find, so I scraped them from their fare calculator at lirr42.mta.info. For the Montauk
 * to Greenport trip described above, for example, the fare calculator returns that a trip via
 * Jamaica is 31.75 (offpeak), and a trip via Hicksville is 28.00 (offpeak). This is still ambiguous
 * - what if you make a trip from Montauk to Greenport but change at Bethpage instead of Hicksville?
 * We are assuming that in this case, you would be able to use the via fare for Hicksville.
 *
 * <p>If there is a via fare for a station specified, we assume that it can also be used for any
 * station closer to the origin/destination than the via station. We define closer as being that
 * that station is reachable from the via station via only outbound trains in the common
 * Inbound-Outbound transfer case, and reachable via only inbound trains in the rare
 * Outbound-Inbound case. If there is no via fare specified, we use two one-way tickets. (The second
 * ticket may be a via fare if there is another opposite direction transfer, for instance Hicksville
 * to Oceanside via Babylon and Lynbrook, but otherwise we use via fares greedily. For an A-B-C-D
 * trip, if there is a via fare from A to C via B, we will buy an ABC and a CD fare even if AB and
 * BCD would be cheaper.)
 *
 * <p>This is further complicated by the fact that there are other transfers that are not via
 * transfers. For example, to travel from Atlantic Terminal to Ronkonkoma on LIRR train 2000, you
 * must change at Jamaica. We thus assume that you can change between any two trains anywhere and as
 * long as you continue to travel in the same direction, it is treated as a single ride for fare
 * calculation purposes.
