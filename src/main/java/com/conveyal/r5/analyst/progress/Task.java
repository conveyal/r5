/**
 * This newer task progress system coexists with several older mechanisms, which it is intended to supersede. It is
 * still evolving as we adapt it to new use cases. The Task class is intended to represent background tasks whose
 * progress the end user should be aware of, such as processing uploaded files. It should not be used for automatic
 * internal actions (such as Events) which would clutter a user's active task list.
 *
 * A Task (or some interface that it implements) could be used by the AsyncLoader to track progress. Together with some
 * AsyncLoader functionality it will be a bit like a Future with progress reporting. Use of AsyncLoader could then be
 * generalized to building TranportNetworks, EgressCostTables, etc. We don't want to run too far with lazy Async loading
 * though, since the end goal is for users to trigger builds manually.
 *
 * Each task should be able to have subtasks, each of which represents an expected percentage of the parent task.
 * Or an expected number of "relative work units" if new sub-tasks will be added on the fly, so absolutes are not known.
 * Tasks should implement ProgressListener functionality, and bubble up progress to parent tasks.
 *
 * TODO rename to BackgroundTask
