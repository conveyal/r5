/**
 * This establishes a mapping between type codes embedded in JSON objects and Java Modification types on R5 workers.
 * It is used to achieve polymorphism in serialization and deserialization to and from JSON.
 * Almost everything here can be achieved with Jackson annotations @JsonTypeInfo and @JsonTypes on the classes.
 * But there's one exception: the custom modification type that pipes arbitrary JSON through the backend to the R5
 * worker. In that case we need to overwrite the type code "custom" with the type code we want the worker to see, which
 * might be completely unknown to the backend.
 *
 * Actually we might be able to perform the bulk of the class/type string mappings using those annotations, and just
 * override the behavior only on the CustomModificationHolder (with a TypeIdResolver that only handles the CustomModificationHolder
 * case). That could be done in addition to moving the R5 CustomModificationHolder to the backend, so it's clearly outside R5.
