/**
 * Insert a new route segment into some trip patterns.
 * This may create new stops or reference existing ones, splicing a new chunk of timetable into/onto an existing route.
 *
 * If both fromStop and toStop are specified, the part of the timetable in between those stops is replaced.
 * If fromStop is null, then the whole timetable is replaced up to the toStop.
 * If toStop in null, then the whole timetable is replaced after fromStop.
 *
 * The number of dwell times specified must always be one greater than the number of hop times.
 * That is to say we supply one dwell time before and after every hop time like so: O=O=O=O=O
 * The number of dwell times must be equal to the number of inserted stops, plus one dwell for fromStop and one dwell
 * for toStop when they are specified.
 *
 * That is to say, a dwell time is supplied for each "anchor stop" referenced in the original trip pattern,
 * and one more for each stop in the stops list. For N dwells, N-1 hops are supplied to tie them all together.
 *
 * Inserting stops into some trips but not others on a pattern could create new patterns. Therefore we only allow
 * applying this modification to entire routes or patterns.
