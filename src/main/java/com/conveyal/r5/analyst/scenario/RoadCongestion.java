/**
 * To simulate traffic congestion, apply a slow-down (or speed-up) factor to roads, according to attributes of polygon
 * features. This replaces the array of edge speeds in a scenario copy of the street layer's edge store.
 * Driving is not available as an egress mode, and the updated speed fields don't affect walking or biking, so this
 * modification should not cause distance tables to be rebuilt, though of course routing with the car mode will
 * cause a car linkage to be built.
 *
 * There are several ways to implement the assignment of a slowdown factor to each edge. These approaches will be more
 * or less efficient, depending on the parameters and polygons chosen. We must iterate over either the edges or the
 * polygons, finding which objects in the other category they intersect. Doing this efficiently requires a spatial index
 * on the second category of objects, to avoid nested iteration and possible N^2 complexity.
 *
 * We can reasonably assume that there will always be many less polygons than street edges.
 * But the total quantity of intersection and length calculations will be roughly equal no matter which is the outer
 * loop: the number of times an edge's bounding box overlaps the bounding box of a polygon. So assuming the intersection
 * math is the slow part of the process, the nesting order is not so significant.
 *
 * We already have an efficiently iterable spatial index of all the edges in the street layer, so we could iterate over
 * all polygons, and set the speed on all edges falling inside them. But some edges intersect multiple polygons. We need
 * to see all these polygons at once to decide which polygon wins. Unless we want to store a lot of auxiliary state
 * (e.g. a map from each updated edge to its current polygon object or a priority value per updated edge), we must
 * iterate over the edges instead of the polygons to have all relevant polygons in hand at once.
 *
 * Additional challenges: Which polygon should we select when there are multiple candidates? Even if all polygons are
 * non-overlapping, a road may touch more than one polygon, or may be partially inside one or more polygons and
 * partially outside all polygons. But in normal usage, it's possible for polygons to overlap partially or completely.
 * A smaller polygon may be entirely inside a larger polygon. This will be the case when a center city polygon is drawn
 * on top of a suburban polygon. We cannot use a simple rule that the polygon with the worst congestion should win,
 * because it's entirely possible that small zones of lower congestion will exist or will be modeled within larger
 * zones of lesser congestion.
 *
 * Therefore we give polygons explicit priorities, which must be positive to beat the default. In ties where the edge
 * falls within two or more polygons with the same priority, the one with the longest overlap wins.
 *
 * At first, assigning speeds to all the edges in the Netherlands from 10 polygons took 25 seconds.
 * Changing to calculate intersection lengths only to break ties, assignment takes 13 seconds.
 * With 151000 polygons, setting speeds on all edges in the Netherlands takes 1 minute and 40 seconds. It is reduced to
 * 57 seconds if we only compute edge fragment lengths in cases where it can have an effect of the scaling factor.
