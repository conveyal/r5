/**
 * The purpose of this class is to optimize the search for a trip schedule for
 * a given pattern and stop. Normally the search scan from the upper bound index
 * and down, it can do so because the trips are ordered after the FIRST stop
 * alight times. We also assume that trips do not pass each other; Hence
 * trips in service on a given day will also be in order for all other stops.
 * For trips operating on different service days (no overlapping) this assumption
 * is not necessary true.
 * <p>
 * The search use a binary search if the number of trip schedules is above a
 * given threshold. A linear search is slow when the number of schedules is very
 * large, let say more than 300 trip schedules.
 *
 * @param <T> The TripSchedule type defined by the user of the range raptor API.
