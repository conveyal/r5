/**
 * The purpose of the TripScheduleSearch is to optimize the search for a trip schedule
 * for a given pattern. Normally the search scan trips sequentially, aborting when a
 * valid trip is found, it can do so because the trips are ordered after the FIRST stop
 * alight/board times. We also assume that trips do not pass each other; Hence trips in
 * service on a given day will be in order for all other stops too.
 * <p/>
 * The search use a binary search if the number of trip schedules is above a given
 * threshold. A linear search is slow when the number of schedules is very large, let
 * say more than 300 trip schedules.
 * <p/>
 * The implementation of this interface is also responsible for adding board slack, and
 * take care the search direction (forward/reverse). For a reverse search (searching
 * backward in time) the trip found departure/arrival times are swapped. This is one of
 * the things that allows for the algorithm to be generic, used in both cases.
 *
 * @param <T> The TripSchedule type defined by the user of the range raptor API.
