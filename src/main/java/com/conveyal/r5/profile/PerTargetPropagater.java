/**
 * Given minimum travel times from a single origin point to all transit stops, this class finds minimum travel times to
 * a grid of destinations ("targets") by walking or biking or driving from the transit stops to the targets.
 * We make one propagator instance per origin point.
 *
 * We find travel times to a single target (grid cell) at a time because we only intend to retain a few percentiles of
 * travel time at each target, rather than retaining the travel time for every Monte Carlo schedule at every departure
 * minute. Propagating the other direction (from stops out to targets) requires retaining every travel time for every
 * Monte Carlo draw/departure time combination at every target. The resulting data structure would be impractically
 * huge. To handle one target at a time rather than one stop at a time, we need to invert the table of distances from
 * stops to their nearby targets: we instead use a table of distances to targets from their nearby stops.
 *
 * Note: this class is not threadsafe. It must process one target at a time sequentially in a single thread.

     * Transpose the travel times to stops array in order to provide better memory locality in the tight loop below.
     * We have confirmed that this provides a significant speedup. TODO quantify that speedup and record here in comment.
     * This speedup is expected because Java represents multidimensional arrays as an array of references to arrays.
     * This means that each row is stored in a separate chunk of address space, and may not be contiguous with
     * other rows. The CPU and cache probably can't efficiently predict and prefetch the values we need next.
     * When we transpose the array, we then have all travel times to a particular stop for all iterations
     * in a single contiguous array. This means we pull in all the travel times for a particular stop into cache, at
     * once, rather than unneeded times for the same iteration at other stops. Since we are also looping over the
     * targets with geographic locality (adjacent cells in the destination grid are geographically adjacent),
     * it is likely that the stops pulled into cache by handling one target will be reused when handling the next target.
     * This should not increase memory consumption very much as we're only duplicating the travel times to transit
     * stops. For example, the Netherlands has about 70,000 stops, if you do 1,000 iterations to 70,000 stops, the
     * array being transposed and duplicated is 70,000 * 1000 * 4 bytes per int ~= 267 megabytes. It does not seem
     * worthwhile to change the routing algorithm to output already-transposed data, as that will create memory
     * locality problems elsewhere (since the pathfinding algorithm solves one iteration for all stops simultaneously).
