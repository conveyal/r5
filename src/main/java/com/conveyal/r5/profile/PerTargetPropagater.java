/**
 * Given minimum travel times from a single origin point to all transit stops, this class finds
 * minimum travel times to a grid of destinations ("targets") by walking or biking or driving from
 * the transit stops to the targets. We make one propagator instance per origin point.
 *
 * <p>We find travel times to a single target (grid cell) at a time because we only intend to retain
 * a few percentiles of travel time at each target, rather than retaining the travel time for every
 * Monte Carlo schedule at every departure minute. Propagating the other direction (from stops out
 * to targets) requires retaining every travel time for every Monte Carlo draw/departure time
 * combination at every target. The resulting data structure would be impractically huge. To handle
 * one target at a time rather than one stop at a time, we need to invert the table of distances
 * from stops to their nearby targets: we instead use a table of distances to targets from their
 * nearby stops.
 *
 * <p>Note: this class is not threadsafe. It must process one target at a time sequentially in a
 * single thread.
