/**
 * The state for a single round of a RAPTOR search.
 * This primarily consists of the best known arrival times at each transit stop for a given number of rides, along with
 * associated data to reconstruct paths and efficiently proceed to the next round.
 *
 * These fields are grouped into a separate class (rather than just having the fields in the raptor worker class)
 * because we need to make copies of them when doing Monte Carlo frequency searches. While performing the range-raptor
 * search, we keep performing raptor searches at different departure times, stepping back in time, but operating on the
 * same set of states (one for each round). But after each one of those departure time searches, we want to run
 * sub-searches with different randomly selected schedules (the Monte Carlo draws). We don't want those sub-searches to
 * invalidate the states for the ongoing range-raptor search, so we make a protective copy.
 *
 * Note that this represents the entire state of the RAPTOR search at all stops for a single round, rather than the
 * state at a particular vertex (transit stop), as is the case with State objects in our street search algorithm.
 *
 * Within each round, transit is processed first, then transfers are processed. There are not separate transfer rounds.
 * A single RaptorState represents everything that happened in a round, including riding transit vehicles and any
 * possible transfers from those transit vehicles to other stops.
