        // jump between them
        // a few times before the suboptimal dominance will cut off the search.

        // from Greenbelt
        // to Franconia-Springfield. Suppose you wanted to go from Greenbelt to Huntington. It would
        // make complete sense
        // to transfer from one yellow line train to another.

        // in DC, which both serve Connecticut Ave between Van Ness-UDC and Farragut Square. The Red
        // Line is much faster

        // trunk.

        // this is still important.

        // way. That's why we
        // apply strict dominance, rather than just forbidding this situation.

        // looping in a function
        // that gets called a lot, and it seems unlikely that there would be time to take two other
