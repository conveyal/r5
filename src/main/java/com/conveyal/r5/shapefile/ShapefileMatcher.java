/**
 * The class ShapefileMain converts shapefiles to OSM data, which is in turn converted to R5 street networks.
 * For various reasons we may prefer to load true OSM data, then overlay the data from the shapefile onto the OSM.
 *
 * Converting shapefiles to OSM then converting that OSM to a network requires the original shapefile to be routable.
 * Nodes in shapefiles do not have identity, only location, so they're inherently ambiguous. This can be resolved in
 * two main ways: by creating new nodes wherever shapes cross, or by assuming any nodes in the same location are the
 * same node (and not two nodes stacked vertically for example). The former does not allow for separation of tunnels
 * and bridges. The latter requires exactly placed nodes on two or more features for every intersection. For example,
 * the end of a road at a T insersection requires a node in the same location on the perpendicular road.
 * It would be possible to hybridize these approaches, for example automatically inserting nodes at T intersections but
 * requiring explicit duplicate nodes at crossing intersections to distinguish them from bridges and tunnels. The
 * details get tricky though: specifically, how close does a line or point have to be to another before it's connected?
 * It is not realistic to require exact matches because data are often drawn by hand, and even machine-generated data
 * may contain roundoff errors. Roads are typically approximated by line segments whose inferred path will be dependent
 * on the projection and geometry functions used - it's not generally possible to place a point exactly "on" another
 * linestring unless that linestring already contains the same point.
 *
 * We can't allow too much slack though. Some roads genuinely come close to creating a T intersection but don't connect
 * due to a barrier such as a fence or canal. These points have critical effects on connectivity and accessibility.
 * For all these reasons we prefer to build our network from a data source like OSM where nodes have identity, and it's
 * clearly defined which roads are connected to each other and where.
 *
 * The shapefiles we wish to process may also be less detailed than our networks from OSM. In the case of speed data
 * they are often much less detailed (containing only trunk roads). In this case we want to keep the network generated
 * from the detailed OSM source data, but match the shapefile features to road segments in that network and copy over
 * attribute values (handling unmatched roads, either by interpolation or defaults).
 *
 * This class matches a supplied shapefile to an already-built network.
