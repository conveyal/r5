/**
 * This main method is a test for the ShapefileMatcher and demonstrates how it's used.
 *
 * Known problems:
 * The input shapefile has ways split at intersections with some dead-end side streets that are not in R5 networks.
 * The shapefile is of type MultiLineString but each feature contains only a single LineString. We unwrap them but we
 * should decide whether to handle this or just throw an error and request conversion.
 * The R5 network includes motorways (because we support car routing) and it tries to match these to bike LTS features.
