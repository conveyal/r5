/**
 * The final stage of a one-to-many transit trip is what we call "propagation": extending travel times out from all
 * transit stops that were reached to all destination points. This needs to be done hundreds or thousands of times for
 * every stop, or for every target grid cell (depending on the number of simulated schedule Monte Carlo draws, and the
 * number of different departure minutes in the analysis).
 *
 * In order to perform propagation quickly, we pre-build tables of travel distance or time from each transit stop to
 * each destination point. These tables remain identical for a given scenario so are cached in the worker once built.
 * Individual requests may specify lower time limits or car speeds, but these tables place hard upper limits on travel
 * time, distance, and speed. For this reason, egress searches are are more limited than searches for transit access.
 *
 * Typically there are fewer transit stops than destination grid cells, so these tables are built outward from the
 * transit stops. The tables are then transposed for actual use in propagation, where we iterate over the destinations.
 *
 * Note that these cost tables are only needed for egress from public transit. They are not needed for a particular
 * mode if that mode is only being used for access to transit or direct travel to the destination points.
 *
 * EgressCostTables are derived from data in a specific LinkedPointSet, and can be thought of as memoized or cached
 * results from computations on that LinkedPointSet. Therefore there is a one-to-one relationship between
 * LinkedPointSet instances and EgressCostTable instances.

     *
     * Throwing away the original stop -> point tables should save a lot of memory. We null out the entries in the
     * source list as they are converted, allowing garbage collection of values.
     *
     * The geographic cropping and scenario base copying processes expect the original stop -> point tables to still
     * exist. However, each table seems to be used only as a source table for copies, or as a propagation table, but not
     * both. Copied tables are always used for propagation, and once any one thread uses it for propagation it should
     * never be a source for any other copies.
     *
     * We were effectively already avoiding data duplication in the region-wide cost tables by never calling the method
     * that lazily transposed the tables.
     * TODO really we should have separate EgressCostTable and PropagationEgressCostTable classes, one copied from the other.
     * One should represent the region, or read-through crops of the whole region, and the other should be per-scenario.
