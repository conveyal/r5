     * Store the best state at the end of each edge. Although we think of states being located at vertices, from a
     * routing point of view they are located just before the vertex, at the end of one of the edges coming into that
     * vertex. This allows us to apply turn costs.
     *
     * You can't properly apply turn costs (which are vertex costs) when you are storing a single state at each vertex,
     * because the vertex cost is not applied until leaving the vertex. This means that a state that must make
     * an expensive U-turn to reach the destination may beat out a state that is slightly less costly _at that vertex_ but
     * will complete the search with a cheap straight-through movement. We use the ends rather than the beginnings of edges
     * to avoid state proliferation (otherwise after traversing an edge you'd have to create states, many of which would
     * be dominated pretty quickly, for every outgoing edge at the to vertex).
     *
     * Storing states per edge is mathematically equivalent to creating a so-called edge-based graph in which all of the
     * street segments have been represented as nodes and all of the intersections/turn possibilities as edges, but that
     * is a very theoretical view and creates a semantic nightmare because it's hard to think about nodes that represent
     * things with dimension (not to mention never being sure whether you're talking about the original, standard graph
     * or the transformed, edge-based graph). We had a nightmarish time trying to keep this straight in OTP, and eventually
     * removed it. Using edge-based graphs to represent turn costs/restrictions is documented at
     * http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/gdata/2013/pin2/d/dokumentace/line_graph_teorie.pdf
     *
     * Though we imagine having multiple states at any vertex, we represent this by associating the states with directed
     * edges, at it seems at first that you would need to keep only one state per directed edge (at its end).
     * However, OSM contains complex turn restrictions that have via ways. This could be a simple U-turn on a dual
     * carriageway, but could also be something more complex (no right turn after left &c.). In these cases, we still
     * have to have incomparable states (states that cannot be dominated by other paths with different characteristics)
     * when we are partway through the restriction.
     *
     * When determining the weight at a vertex, one should just grab the states at the ends of all the incoming edges,
     * and take the minimum. However, turn costs make it a bit more complicated to properly determine the time/weight
     * at a destination along a road that is not represented by a vertex. Suppose that the best state at one of the
     * endpoint vertices of the destination edge requires a left turn onto that destination edge. It is important to
     * apply that left turn cost. Even more important is to make sure that the destination edge is not the end of a
     * restricted turn; if it is, one must reach the destination via an alternate state.
     *
     * TODO we might be able to make this more efficient (not using a multimap)
     * by taking advantage of the fact that we almost always have a single state per edge
     * (the only time we don't is when we're in the middle of a turn restriction).
