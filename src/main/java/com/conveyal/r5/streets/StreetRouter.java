     * Store the best state at the end of each edge. We store states at the ends of edges, rather than at vertices, so
     * that we can apply turn costs. You can't apply turn costs (which are vertex costs) when you are storing a single state
     * per vertex, because the vertex cost is not applied until leaving the vertex. This means that a state that must make
     * an expensive U-turn to reach the destination may beat out a state that is slightly less costly _at that vertex_ but
     * will complete the search with a cheap straight-through movement. We use the ends rather than the beginnings of edges
     * to avoid state proliferation (otherwise after traversing an edge you'd have to create states, many of which would
     * be dominated pretty quickly, for every outgoing edge at the to vertex).
     *
     * Storing states per edge is mathematically equivalent to creating a so-called edge-based graph in which all of the
     * street segments have been represented as nodes and all of the intersections/turn possibilities as edges, but that
     * is a very theoretical view and creates a semantic nightmare because it's hard to think about nodes that represent
     * things with dimension (not to mention never being sure whether you're talking about the original, standard graph
     * or the transformed, edge-based graph). We had a nightmarish time trying to keep this straight in OTP, and eventually
     * removed it. Using edge-based graphs to represent turn costs/restrictions is documented at http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/gdata/2013/pin2/d/dokumentace/line_graph_teorie.pdf
     *
     * This would seem to obviate the need to have incomparable states at all, but it in fact does not, because of the existence
     * of complex turn restrictions that have via ways. This could be a simple U-turn on a dual carriageway, but could also be
     * something more complex (no right turn after left &c.). In these cases, we still have to have incomparable states when
     * we are partway through the restriction.
     *
     * When determining the weight at a vertex, one should just grab all the incoming edges, and take the minimum. However,
     * it's a bit more complicated to properly determine the time/weight at a split, because of turn costs. Suppose that
     * the best state at a particular vertex require a left turn onto the split edge; it is important to apply that left
     * turn costs. Even more important is to make sure that the split edge is not the end of a restricted turn; if it is,
     * one must reach the split via an alternate state.
