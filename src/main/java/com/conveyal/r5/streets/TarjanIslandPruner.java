/**
 * Prune islands from a graph using Tarjan's strong-components algorithm, described in Tarjan, R.
 * “Depth-First Search and Linear Graph Algorithms.” SIAM Journal on Computing 1, no. 2 (1972):
 * 146–60. doi:10.1137/0201010. and summarized at
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
 *
 * <p>We prune islands by mode; what is an island for pedestrians is probably not an island for
 * cars.
 *
 * <p>Note that the order in which you remove islands for different modes is important. Island
 * removal for cycling should be done after island removal for walking, because we allow walking
 * bikes. Consider the following situation, where * represents a vertex or small island, -B-
 * represents a bikeable edge, and -W- represents a walkable edge:
 *
 * <p>* -B- * -W- * -B- * -W- * -B- *
 *
 * <p>There is no island here for bikes, because they can simply be walked down the walking street.
 * However, there are walking islands here, and the walk permissions on edges will be removed
 * because they are part of islands. At that point there will be biking islands. Thus the walk
 * island removal must be run before the bike island removal.
 *
 * <p>This way we are not simply removing islands that are in weak components, but removing islands
 * that are in strong components (a weak component is one where for every pair of vertices i and j,
 * there is a path i -> j or a path j -> i but not necessarily both, whereas a strong component has
 * both). This is most relevant for cars; there are few one-way pedestrian streets (and I don't
 * believe r5 even supports them), and it is legal to walk a bike the wrong way down a one way
 * street. One-way cul-de-sacs are clearly a data error but do exist, for instance
 * http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/207971576 which is a ramp into an unmapped parking garage in
 * Arlington, VA, USA.
 *
 * <p>One concern with this island remover is that it does not consider turn restrictions, so it
 * theoretically would leave a situation like this in the graph:
 *
 * <p>B - C | A
 *
 * <p>Suppose all edges can be traversed by cars in both directions, but there is a no-right-turn
 * restriction from AB to BC. C is not part of a larger strong component because it cannot be
 * reached due to the turn restriction. However, this case is believed to be sufficiently rare not
 * to worry about.
 *
 * <p>The algorithm used here is a modified version of the one Tarjan described; Tarjan's algorithm
 * used recursion, but with real world graphs a naïve implementation using recursion quickly caused
 * a StackOverflow in the JVM. The modified algorithm works as follows.
 *
 * <p>Tarjan's algorithm uses a depth-first search. We loop over all vertices, and when we find one
 * that hasn't been explored, we add it to the toExplore stack.
 *
 * <p>We then pop a vertex off the toExplore stack. If it has not previously been explored, we give
 * it a consecutive discovery index, set the lowest-discovery-index vertex that is both reachable
 * from this vertex and a is also a predecessor vertex to the itself, and we add it to the tarjan
 * stack to indicate it is a precessor of any vertices explored later in the search. We push this
 * vertex back on the toExplore stack to make sure it is updated once all successor nodes have been
 * explored, and then loop over all the edges usable by the chosen mode originating from the
 * selected vertex.
 *
 * <p>For each edge, we check if the target vertex has previously been explored. If it has not, we
 * put the source vertex and then the target vertex back on the toExplore stack. This way, the
 * target vertex will be popped from the toExplore stack and explored, and then the source vertex
 * will be popped and updated. If it has, we check if it is on the tarjan stack; if it has, we know
 * that it is a predecessor to the source vertex, and update the lowest-discovery-index predecessor
 * based on the discovery index of the target vertex.
 *
 * <p>If the vertex popped off the toExplore stack has already been explored, we first check all
 * successors; if they have a higher discovery index than the vertex popped off the stack, we know
 * they were explored downstream of the source vertex, and their lowest-discovery-index predecessor
 * was on the Tarjan stack when they were explored. If the lowest-discovery-index predecessor is
 * less than the lowest-discovery-index predecessor of the popped vertex, we update the
 * lowest-discovery-index predecessor of the popped vertex. This looping over edges is potentially
 * less efficient than the original implementation which used the call stack to keep track of which
 * successors could have been updated, but it is simple, eliminates recursion, and is quick even in
 * relatively large street networks.
 *
 * <p>If the vertex popped off the toExplore stack has itself as the lowest-discovery-index
 * predecessor, we have found a strong component. We pop vertices off the Tarjan stack until we
 * reach the vertex popped from the toExplore stack. These vertices form a strong component, which
 * we record.
 *
 * <p>Once all strong components have been found, we loop through all of them and if they have a
 * size less than the minimum component size, we remove permissions for the relevant mode from all
 * edges connected to their vertices.
 *
 * <p>We previously used a flood-fill algorithm designed for undirected graphs. This worked okay for
 * walking and biking because the graph is effectively undirected; for every edge there is a
 * corresponding back edge (we don't support one-way streets for walking, and walking a bike the
 * wrong way down a one-way street is always an option). However, for cars this is an issue; there
 * can be components due to bad data that are one-way cul-de-sacs (or small islands of streets
 * connected to the outside world only by a one-way street). Obviously this is bad data or we'd have
 * a lot of cars piled up in one place, but in some sense needing to do island removal at all is a
 * fix for bad data; islands should not exist in OSM (except for physical islands that must be
 * reached by boat, etc). (cf. Sachar, Louis. Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger. New York,
 * HarperCollins. 1995, in which one-way elevators are installed).
