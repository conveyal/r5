/**
 * We lazy-load and lazy-build a lot of things, including TransportNetworks, grid linkages, and distance tables.
 * We used Guava LoadingCaches for these, so subsequent requests would block and share a single instance of the
 * requested object. But these operations can be slow - in the tens of minutes sometimes. It's not reasonable to
 * silently hold HTTP connections open that long, leaving the client uninformed as to whether something has crashed.
 *
 * We instead prefer to fail fast, informing the client that the object is being loaded or computed.
 * Guava does not cleanly support such cases:
 * https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1350
 *
 * This is actually more of a Map than a Cache since it doesn't support eviction yet.
 * Maybe it's an AsyncLazyLoadingConcurrentMap.
 *
 * We could use a ConcurrentMap internally, except that putIfAbsent doesn't allow us to easily trigger an additional
 * task enqueue operation or retain a reference to the value that was put by default.
 * Consider whether you really want eviction - if not, requesting status for a key and requesting value can be done
 * with separate methods, since status always proceeds in a single direction with the final stage being
 * "value is present in map".
 *
 * Potential problem: if we try to return immediately saying whether the needed data are available,
 * there are some cases where preparing the reqeusted object might take only a few hundred milliseconds or less.
 * In that case then we don't want the caller to have to re-poll. In this case a Future.get() with timeout is good.
