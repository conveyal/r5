/**
 * Allows counting iterations and logging inside lambda expressions, including those within parallel
 * streams. Java does not allow you to modify a primitive in a lambda expression, but you can modify
 * a primitive via a constant reference to an object containing it. The thinking behind disallowing
 * such modifications is that it prevents non-threadsafe access, which is odd considering that you
 * can do all sorts of other non threadsafe things and people are not always using parallel streams.
 *
 * <p>To solve all these problems, this class allows you to update a counter in a threadsafe way and
 * log messages when it passes certain values. An instance that is "effectively final" can still
 * have its increment method called in a lambda function.
