/**
 * This class tracks incoming requests from workers to consume Analyst tasks, and attempts to match those
 * requests to enqueued tasks. It aims to draw tasks fairly from all users, and fairly from all jobs within each user,
 * while attempting to respect the graph affinity of each worker (give it tasks that require the same graph it has been
 * working on recently).
 *
 * When no work is available or no workers are available, the polling functions return immediately, avoiding spin-wait.
 * When they are receiving no work, workers are expected to disconnect and re-poll occasionally, on the order of 30
 * seconds. This serves as a signal to the broker that they are still alive and waiting.
 *
 * TODO if there is a backlog of work (the usual case when jobs are lined up) workers will constantly change graphs.
 * Because (at least currently) two users never share the same graph, we can get by with pulling tasks cyclically or
 * randomly from all the jobs, and just actively shaping the number of workers with affinity for each graph by forcing
 * some of them to accept tasks on graphs other than the one they have declared afffinity for.
 *
 * This could be thought of as "affinity homeostasis". We  will constantly keep track of the ideal proportion of workers
 * by graph (based on active queues), and the true proportion of consumers by graph (based on incoming requests) then
 * we can decide when a worker's graph affinity should be ignored and what it should be forced to.
 *
 * It may also be helpful to mark jobs every time they are skipped in the LRU queue. Each time a job is serviced,
 * it is taken out of the queue and put at its end. Jobs that have not been serviced float to the top.
