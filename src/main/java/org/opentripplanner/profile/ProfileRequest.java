      This parameter compensates for the fact that GTFS does not contain information about schedule deviation (lateness).
      The min-max travel time range for some trains is zero, since the trips are reported to always have the same
      timings in the schedule. Such an option does not overlap (temporally) its alternatives, and is too easily
      eliminated by an alternative that is only marginally better. We want to effectively push the max travel time of
      alternatives out a bit to account for the fact that they don't always run on schedule.
