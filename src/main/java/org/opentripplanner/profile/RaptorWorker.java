/**
 * A RaptorWorker carries out RAPTOR searches on a pre-filtered, compacted representation of all the trips running
 * during a given time window. It originated as a rewrite of our RAPTOR code that would use "thin workers", allowing
 * computation by a generic function-execution service like AWS Lambda. The gains in efficiency were significant enough
 * that RaptorWorkers are now used in the context of a full-size OTP server executing spatial analysis tasks.
 *
 * We can imagine that someday all OTP searches, including simple point-to-point searches, may be carried out on such
 * compacted tables, including both the transit and street searches (via a compacted street network in a column store
 * or struct-like byte array using something like the FastSerialization library).
 *
 * This implements the RAPTOR algorithm; see http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/156567/raptor_alenex.pdf

     * be used to reconstruct a path (although potentially not the one that was used to get to a particular
     * location, as a later round may have found a faster but more-transfers way to get there). A path
     * reconstructed this way will tbus be optimal in the earliest-arrival sense but may not have the
     * fewest transfers; in fact, it will tend not to.
     *
     * Consider the case where there is a slower one-seat ride and a quicker route with a transfer
     * to get to a transit center. At the transit center you board another vehicle. If it turns out
     * that you still catch that vehicle at the same time regardless of which option you choose,
     * general utility theory would suggest that you would choose the one seat ride due to a) the
     * inconvenience of the transfer and b) the fact that most people have a smaller disutility for
     * in-vehicle time than waiting time, especially if the waiting is exposed to the elements, etc.
     *
     * However, this implementation will find the more-transfers trip because it doesn't know where you're
     * going from the transit center, whereas true RAPTOR would find both. It's not non-optimal in the
     * earliest arrival sense, but it's also not the only optimal option.
     *
     * All of that said, we could reconstruct paths simply by storing one more parallel array with
     * the index of the stop that you boarded a particular pattern at. Then we can do the typical
     * reverse-optimization step.
