/**
 * Perform one-to-many profile routing using repeated RAPTOR searches. In this context, profile routing means finding
 * the optimal itinerary for each departure moment in a given window, without trying to reconstruct the exact paths.
 *
 * In other contexts (Modeify-style point to point routing) we would want to include suboptimal but resonable paths
 * and retain enough information to reconstruct all those paths accounting for common trunk frequencies and stop clusters.
 *
 * This method is conceptually very similar to the work of the Minnesota Accessibility Observatory
 * (http://www.its.umn.edu/Publications/ResearchReports/pdfdownloadl.pl?id=2504)
 * They run repeated searches for each departure time in the window. We take advantage of the fact that the street
 * network is static (for the most part, assuming time-dependent turn restrictions and traffic are consistent across
 * the time window) and only run a fast transit search for each minute in the window.
