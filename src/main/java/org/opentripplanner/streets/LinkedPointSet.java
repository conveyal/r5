/**
 * A LinkedPointSet is a PointSet that has been pre-connected to a StreetLayer in a non-destructive, reversible way.
 *
 * This is a replacement for SampleSet.
 * It is a column store of locations that have not been permanently spliced into the graph.
 * We cannot just adapt the SampleSet constructor because it holds on to OTP Vertex objects. In the new system we have
 * only vertex indexes. Well, there are Vertex cursor objects but we're not going to save those.
 * Likewise for TimeSurfaces which are intersected with SampleSets. They are keyed on Vertex references so need to be replaced.
 *
 * Semi-obsolete notes:
 * Note that we don't ever need to traverse into a temporary vertex, only out of one, so temporary vertices do not
 * interfere at all with the permanent graph.
 * A temp vertex set can be used for a big set of vertices, but also for single origin and target vertices in
 * point to point searches.
 * Temp vertex sets can be persisted in the graph itself to save a worker the effort of loading street geometries and
 * re-linking stops.
 *
 * We can't use TempVertexSets to handle linking transit stops into the street network, because we want other
 * TempVertexSets to see the transit stop splitters as permanent and insert themselves between the intersection and the
 * transit stop splitter vertex.
 *
 * Searches always proceed outward from origins or targets (think StopTreeCache for the targets, which handles the last
 * mile from transit to targets). We can have completely temporary vertices that are not even recorded in the main
 * transport network store.
 * Keep in mind that if origins and destinations are pre-linked into the graph, the street geometries or even the
 * whole street layer can be dropped entirely, and itâ€™s still useful for routing. So the TransportNetwork must be
 * serializable and usable with a null StreetLayer.
