/**
 * This is like a SampleSet and a StopTreeCache rolled into one. It is a column store of vertices. Note that we don't
 * ever need to traverse into a temporary vertex, only out of one, so temporary vertices do not interfere at all with
 * the permanent graph.
 *
 * A temp vertex set can be used for a big set of vertices, but also for single origin and target vertices in
 * point to point searches.
 *
 * Temp vertex sets can be persisted in the graph itself to save a worker the effort of loading street geometries and
 * re-linking stops.
 *
 * We can't use TempVertexSets to handle linking transit stops into the street network, because we want other
 * TempVertexSets to see the transit stop splitters as permanent and insert themselves between the intersection and the
 * transit stop splitter vertex.
 *
 * Searches always proceed outward from origins or targets (think StopTreeCache for the targets, which handles the last mile from transit to targets). We can have completely temporary vertices that are not even recorded in the main transport network store.
 * Keep in mind that if origins and destinations are pre-linked into the graph, the street geometries or even the whole street layer can be dropped entirely, and itâ€™s still useful for routing. So the TransportNetwork must be serializable and usable with a null StreetLayer.
