 * This is used in testing, to represent and create gridded transport systems with very regular spacing of roads and
 * transit stops, yielding highly predictable travel times that can be tested against actual output from the router.
 *
 * A square grid of points is established to the north and east of a specified origin point, and roads are constructed
 * running horizontally and vertically through the points. Each grid point is then a road intersection. These grid
 * points are assigned 2D integer coordinates, with higher-numbered grid points corresponding to higher latitudes and
 * longitudes. That is to say, grid y coordinates increase from south to north and x coordinates from west to east.
 *
 * Horizontal and vertical transit lines can be added running along the streets at regular headways. The speed of these
 * lines is such that they traverse each block in a round number of seconds.
