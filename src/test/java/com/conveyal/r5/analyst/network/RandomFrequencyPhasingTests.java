    /**
     * This recreates the problem in issue #740, inspired by the structure of STM Montréal GTFS métro schedules.
     * This involves a pattern with two different frequency trips on two different services. The first service has
     * N freq entries, and the second has more than N entries.
     *
     * Here we make one weekday trip with a single frequency entry, and one weekend trip with two frequency entries.
     * We search on the weekend, causing the weekday trip to be filtered out. The Monte Carlo boarding code expects
     * an array of two offsets for the weekend trip, but sees a single offset intended for the weekday trip. In addition
     * the offsets generated for the weekday service will be in the range (0...30) while the headway of the weekend
     * service is much shorter - many generated offsets will exceed the headway. So at least two different assertions
     * can fail here, but whether they will actually fail depends on the order of the TripSchedules in the TripPattern
     * (the weekend trip must come after the weekday one, so filtering causes a decrease in trip index). This depends
     * in turn on the iteration order of the GtfsFeed.trips map, which follows the natural order of its keys so should
     * be determined by the lexical order of trip IDs, which are determined by the order in which timetables are added
     * to the GridRoute.
     *
     * The problem exists even if the mismatched trips have the same number of entries but can fail silently as offsets
     * are computed for the wrong headways. The output travel time range will even be correct, but the distribution will
     * be skewed by the offsets being randomly selected from a different headway, while the headway itself is accurate.
     *
     * The structure created here can only be created by input GTFS, and cannot be produced by our Conveyal scenarios.
     * In scenarios, we always produce exactly one frequency entry per trip. This does not mean scenarios are immune
     * to the problem of using offsets from the wrong trip - it's just much harder to detect the problem as all arrays
     * are the same length, so it can fail silently.
